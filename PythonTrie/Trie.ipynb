    "# Word Search Suggestion System\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is a prototype of a search suggestion system, inspired by how modern search engines provide real-time recommendations as users type. The system simulates the behavior of autocomplete features commonly seen in search engines like Google, where the most relevant or frequently selected terms appear at the top of the suggestion list.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The primary goal is to build a system that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Efficiently retrieves all words that begin with a given prefix.\n",
    "- Suggests alternative or similar words when an exact prefix match isn't found.\n",
    "- Sorts suggestions based on how frequently they have been selected in the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prototype mimics this behavior using a simplified dataset of words and tracks how often each word is chosen, enabling dynamic and frequency-based sorting of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "- Trie (Prefix Tree):\n",
    "A trie is used to store the list of words in a structured way that allows fast retrieval based on prefixes. This ensures that, given a search string, all matching words can be found efficiently by traversing down the trie.\n",
    "\n",
    "- HashMap (Dictionary):\n",
    "A dictionary (searchedWords) is used to track how many times each word has been selected. This enables the system to sort and prioritize frequently chosen words in future search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "- Depth-First Search (DFS):\n",
    "DFS is used to recursively traverse the trie and collect all words that share a given prefix. This is essential when we need to suggest all possible completions for a user's input.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Quick Sort:\n",
    "Once potential suggestions are found, they are sorted based on their frequency using Quick Sort. This helps ensure that more popular search terms appear earlier in the list of recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n"

    "## TrieNode\n",
    "\n",
    "The TrieNode class is the fundamental building block of a Trie data structure. It defines the structure and attributes of each node within the Trie.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Each node contains the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- value : Represents the character stored at the current node. It typically holds a character from the set [a-zA-Z0-9], but can also support special characters depending on the use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "- children : A dictionary that maps each child character to its corresponding TrieNode. This allows dynamic branching for every possible continuation of the prefix.\n",
    "\n",
    "- isEnd : A boolean flag that indicates whether this node marks the end of a valid word in the Trie. This is essential for distinguishing complete words from prefixes."

For each invocation, the function returns a list of up to 10 recommended words based on the current input (i.e., the searchString). These suggestions are ordered by how frequently each word has been selected in the past, mimicking how real search engines prioritize popular searches.\n",
